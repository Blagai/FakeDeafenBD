# FakeDeafenBD
A Better Discord plugin that allows you to appear as defeaned while still hearing and talking.

It works dumb right now - you have to join a call, deafen, turn on the plugin, turn it off, and undeafen.
I'll automate it when I have time, it shouldn't be too hard

This plugin uses the Better Discord and the ZeresPluginLibrary, so thanks to https://github.com/BetterDiscord and https://github.com/rauenzi.
