A Better Discord plugin that allows you to appear deafened while still hearing and talking.

I'll automate it when I have time, it shouldn't be too hard.

Download the release version or it won't work, I'm in the middle of building a new version using the repo.

This plugin uses the Better Discord and the ZeresPluginLibrary, so thanks to https://github.com/BetterDiscord and https://github.com/rauenzi.

I would be making some more Better Discord plugins in the future. If you have some ideas or would like to help hit me up on Discord (old account so I have usernames already) chloethebitch
