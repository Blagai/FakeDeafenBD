A Better Discord plugin that allows you to appear deafened while still hearing and talking.

I'll automate it when I have time, it shouldn't be too hard.

Download the release version or it won't work, I'm in the middle of building a new version rn.

This plugin uses Better Discord and the ZeresPluginLibrary, so thanks to https://github.com/BetterDiscord and https://github.com/rauenzi.
